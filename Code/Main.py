Hi, I'm Frederico Dargel, AKA, BikerViking!

This game is a project that I've started in my free time while I was
studiyng programing by myself

The game main concept is rougelike, a game where everytime you play the
map will be randomly generated.
So map layout, monsters, loot, will be random.
Roguelikes also have permadeath, so once you die that's it. You'll need
to start over from the beginning.

My game is called Catacombs - and the game's name kinda spoils the main
idea behind it.

The idea is to make your hero's death meaninfull for the next
playthrough and on.
So, when you die, the game's algorthim will decide what really happens
to that Hero.
In your next playthrough and on, will be able to find your dead heroes
inside the dungeon.
Sometimes the dead hero it's just a corpse that you can loot
but the dead hero can have multiple fates such as: a hopeless soul
seeking something, or a undead friendly npc that will sell itens, or
even be a minibosses

And the end of the dungeon you'll find the dungeon soul, a been that
represents the dungeon itself.
It will tell the hero that he is actually a bad guy. He invaded his
domain, killed inocent monsters, raided the place.
But It's not like he is mad or something. It knows the human condition.
Humans, in It's point of view, are exploeres and conquerers. And their
ethical values are very questionable, contradictory, selfish and
hypocritical.
By sharing his point of view, It makes the hero an offer:

The hero can either go away with everything that his body and mind can
barer
or the hero can fight the dungeon to put a end on this story.

IF the player chooses to go away, he'll need to make his way out of the
dungeon. He'll see each and every creature that he murdered and the
ones that are still alive now run away. The dungeon traps will also be
deactivated.
When the hero reaches the exit he'll drop all his belongings, write a
letter and jump off a cliff.

The next playthrough after this one starts with the aged gear, but it' 
a little big stronger than starter gear, of the previous hero and his 
suicide letter.

BUT IF the player chooses to fight, and wins, the dungeon corpse will 
reveal a big soul which will be absorved by the hero.
That will reset the dead heroes from the dungeon and unlock new itens,
monsters and a few more floors to the next playthrough.

You probalby felt that there is a meaning behind it all. And there
really is. It's going to be fun to see all the theories and interpretations
of the game's lore.

I hope that you enjoy the concept and my game, once I finish it.
Consider donate if you do.
