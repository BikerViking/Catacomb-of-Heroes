Hey, hi!

I'm Frederico Dargel!

This game is a project that I've startet in my free time while I was studying programing by myself. The game is going to be a simple Roguelike*.

The main mechanic of my game is to make death meaningful by tracking the attempts to reach the bottom of the dungeon, so in the next playthrough and on, the player can come across the dead heroes which can take various forms; from a dead corpse that players can loot for items, to minibosses.

By doing so, players are filling the dungeon with dead characters, making their own catacombs - which is the name of the game.

*"Roguelike is a subgenre of role-playing video games, characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated game levels, 
turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player-character." - Wikipedia.
